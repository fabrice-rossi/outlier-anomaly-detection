    abstract = { The presence of outliers, which are data points that
deviate markedly from others, is one of the most
enduring and pervasive methodological challenges in
organizational science research. We provide evidence
that different ways of defining, identifying, and
handling outliers alter substantive research
conclusions. Then, we report results of a literature
review of 46 methodological sources (i.e., journal
articles, book chapters, and books) addressing the
topic of outliers, as well as 232 organizational
science journal articles mentioning issues about
outliers. Our literature review uncovered (a) 14
unique and mutually exclusive outlier definitions,
39 outlier identification techniques, and 20
different ways of handling outliers; (b)
inconsistencies in how outliers are defined,
identified, and handled in various methodological
sources; and (c) confusion and lack of transparency
in how outliers are addressed by substantive
researchers. We offer guidelines, including
decision-making trees, that researchers can follow
to define, identify, and handle error, interesting,
and influential (i.e., model fit and prediction)
outliers. Although our emphasis is on regression,
structural equation modeling, and multilevel
modeling, our general framework forms the basis for
a research agenda regarding outliers in the context
of other data-analytic approaches. Our
recommendations can be used by authors as well as
journal editors and reviewers to improve the
consistency and transparency of practices regarding
the treatment of outliers in organizational science
research. },

abstract={In recent years, a variety of research areas have contributed to a set of related problems with rare event, anomaly, novelty and outlier detection terms as the main actors. These multiple research areas have created a mix-up between terminology and problems. In some research, similar problems have been named differently; while in some other works, the same term has been used to describe different problems. This confusion between terms and problems causes the repetition of research and hinders the advance of the field. Therefore, a standardization is imperative. The goal of this paper is to underline the differences between each term, and organize the area by looking at all these terms under the umbrella of supervised classification. Therefore, a one-to-one assignment of terms to learning scenarios is proposed. In fact, each learning scenario is associated with the term most frequently used in the literature. In order to validate this proposal, a set of experiments retrieving papers from Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore has been carried out.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract={Anomalies are occurrences in a dataset that are in some way unusual and do not fit the general patterns. The concept of the anomaly is typically ill defined and perceived as vague and domain-dependent. Moreover, despite some 250 years of publications on the topic, no comprehensive and concrete overviews of the different types of anomalies have hitherto been published. By means of an extensive literature review this study therefore offers the first theoretically principled and domain-independent typology of data anomalies and presents a full overview of anomaly types and subtypes. To concretely define the concept of the anomaly and its different manifestations, the typology employs five dimensions: data type, cardinality of relationship, anomaly level, data structure, and data distribution. These fundamental and data-centric dimensions naturally yield 3 broad groups, 9 basic types, and 63 subtypes of anomalies. The typology facilitates the evaluation of the functional capabilities of anomaly detection algorithms, contributes to explainable data science, and provides insights into relevant topics such as local versus global anomalies.},

In this review, we aim to identify the common underlying principles and the assumptions that are often made implicitly by various methods. In particular, we draw connections between classic “shallow” and novel deep approaches and show how this relation might cross-fertilize or extend both directions. We further provide an empirical assessment of major existing methods that are enriched by the use of recent explainability techniques and present specific worked-through examples together with practical advice.

abstract = {Anomaly detection has numerous applications in diverse fields. For example, it has been widely used for discovering network intrusions and malicious events. It has also been used in numerous other applications such as identifying medical malpractice or credit fraud. Detection of anomalies in quantitative data has received a considerable attention in the literature and has a venerable history. By contrast, and despite the widespread availability use of categorical data in practice, anomaly detection in categorical data has received relatively little attention as compared to quantitative data. This is because detection of anomalies in categorical data is a challenging problem. Some anomaly detection techniques depend on identifying a representative pattern then measuring distances between objects and this pattern. Objects that are far from this pattern are declared as anomalies. However, identifying patterns and measuring distances are not easy in categorical data compared with quantitative data. Fortunately, several papers focussing on the detection of anomalies in categorical data have been published in the recent literature. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the research on the anomaly detection problem in categorical data. Previous review articles focus on either the statistics literature or the machine learning and computer science literature. This review article combines both literatures. We review 36 methods for the detection of anomalies in categorical data in both literatures and classify them into 12 different categories based on the conceptual definition of anomalies they use. For each approach, we survey anomaly detection methods, and then show the similarities and differences among them. We emphasize two important issues, the number of parameters each method requires and its time complexity. The first issue is critical, because the performance of these methods are sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The time complexity is also very important in real applications especially in big data applications. We report the time complexity if it is reported by the authors of the methods. If it is not, then we derive it ourselves and report it in this article. In addition, we discuss the common problems and the future directions of the anomaly detection in categorical data.},

abstract={Anomaly detection in high dimensional data is becoming a fundamental research problem that has various applications in the real world. However, many existing anomaly detection techniques fail to retain sufficient accuracy due to so-called ``big data'' characterised by high-volume, and high-velocity data generated by variety of sources. This phenomenon of having both problems together can be referred to the ``curse of big dimensionality,'' that affect existing techniques in terms of both performance and accuracy. To address this gap and to understand the core problem, it is necessary to identify the unique challenges brought by the anomaly detection with both high dimensionality and big data problems. Hence, this survey aims to document the state of anomaly detection in high dimensional big data by representing the unique challenges using a triangular model of vertices: the problem (big dimensionality), techniques/algorithms (anomaly detection), and tools (big data applications/frameworks). Authors' work that fall directly into any of the vertices or closely related to them are taken into consideration for review. Furthermore, the limitations of traditional approaches and current strategies of high dimensional data are discussed along with recent techniques and applications on big data required for the optimization of anomaly detection.},

abstract={Detecting outliers is a significant problem that has been studied in various research and application areas. Researchers continue to design robust schemes to provide solutions to detect outliers efficiently. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and organized review of the progress of outlier detection methods from 2000 to 2019. First, we offer the fundamental concepts of outlier detection and then categorize them into different techniques from diverse outlier detection techniques, such as distance-, clustering-, density-, ensemble-, and learning-based methods. In each category, we introduce some state-of-the-art outlier detection methods and further discuss them in detail in terms of their performance. Second, we delineate their pros, cons, and challenges to provide researchers with a concise overview of each technique and recommend solutions and possible research directions. This paper gives current progress of outlier detection techniques and provides a better understanding of the different outlier detection methods. The open research issues and challenges at the end will provide researchers with a clear path for the future of outlier detection methods.},

abstract = {Outlier detection has been a topic in statistics for centuries. Over mainly the last two decades, there has been also an increasing interest in the database and data mining community to develop scalable methods for outlier detection. Initially based on statistical reasoning, however, these methods soon lost the direct probabilistic interpretability of the derived outlier scores. Here, we detail from a joint point of view of data mining and statistics the roots and the path of development of statistical outlier detection and of database-related data mining methods for outlier detection. We discuss their inherent meaning, review approaches to again find a statistically meaningful interpretation of outlier scores, and sketch related current research topics.

abstract = {Abstract High-dimensional data in Euclidean space pose special challenges to data mining algorithms. These challenges are often indiscriminately subsumed under the term ‘curse of dimensionality’, more concrete aspects being the so-called ‘distance concentration effect’, the presence of irrelevant attributes concealing relevant information, or simply efficiency issues. In about just the last few years, the task of unsupervised outlier detection has found new specialized solutions for tackling high-dimensional data in Euclidean space. These approaches fall under mainly two categories, namely considering or not considering subspaces (subsets of attributes) for the definition of outliers. The former are specifically addressing the presence of irrelevant attributes, the latter do consider the presence of irrelevant attributes implicitly at best but are more concerned with general issues of efficiency and effectiveness. Nevertheless, both types of specialized outlier detection algorithms tackle challenges specific to high-dimensional data. In this survey article, we discuss some important aspects of the ‘curse of dimensionality’ in detail and survey specialized algorithms for outlier detection from both categories. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
